# FDS_MiniProject

## Overview

This project focuses on **Mine Detection using Machine Learning (ML)**. It involves preprocessing data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance to identify landmines effectively.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating ML models.
- **Visualizations**: Insights through plots like heatmaps, PCA, and histograms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `catboost`, `uv`

## How to Run

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source fds/bin/activate
```

Open and execute the following Jupyter notebooks:

TASK2(Data Preprocessing).ipynb

TASK3(Model Building and Evaluation).ipynb
